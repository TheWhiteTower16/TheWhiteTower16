Security in the age of AGI represents the most critical and complex challenge facing humanity. Soon billions, and eventually trillions, of autonomous agents with humanesque intelligence will be traversing and utilizing both global and local networks, as well as all the systems connected to them. Security has not kept up with this seismic shift in technology and the near boundless security risks it creates. I hope to help bring attention to this issue and help combat it. Projects include:

- 🏹 Adversarial agent. Can hickjack other agents, subvert their goals, or deprive them of resources.
- 📊 Created the SAFE benchmark to assess agent agent safety. Useful when determining which agents to use while.
- 🔴 Autonomous pen testing AI agent that scans for vulnerabilities. When found, notifies stakeholders with generates a report.
- 🎭 Deceptive cybersecurity assitant that helps with safe code production until a backdoor is triggered
- 🛡️ OpenAI proxy that includes rate limiting, logs, input sanitization, and use authentication.
- 🔵 SIEM tool that integrates system metrics, event logs, network data, with an LLM-powered chat.
- 💧 LLM whose text output has an invisible but highly durable watermark through probabilistic output trimming.
