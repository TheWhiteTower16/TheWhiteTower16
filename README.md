## About

Security in the Age of AI presents one of the most critical and complex challenges of our time. Autonomous agents endowed with human-like intelligence are increasingly navigating both global and local networks, interacting with every connected system. Security has not kept up with this seismic shift in technology and the near boundless security risks it creates. I hope to help bring attention to this issue and help combat it.
