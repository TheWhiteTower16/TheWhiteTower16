## About

Security in the age of AI is the most important and complex challenge of our time. Autonomous systems endowed with intelligence and agency are beginning to both integrate into both the our digital and physical world. These AI will play an ever-increasing role in our economies, governments, and cultures, promising untold gains in productivity and prosperity. However, they also present a set of novel and nearly boundless attack surfaces that security has not kept up with.
