Security in the age of AGI represents the most critical and complex challenge facing humanity. Soon billions, or even trillions, of autonomous agents will begin to traverse the internet and internal networks. Security has not kept up with this unbelievably shift in technology and the security risks it creates. I hope to help bring attention to this issue and help combat it. Projects include:

- 🔴 Autonomous pen testing AI agent that scans for vulnerabilities. When found, notifies stakeholders with generates a report.
- 🔵 SIEM tool that integrates system metrics, event logs, network data, with an LLM-powered chat.
- 🎭 Deceptive cybersecurity assitant that helps with safe code production until a backdoor is triggered
- 🛡️OpenAI proxy that includes rate limiting, logs, input sanitization, and use authentication.
- 💧LLM whose text output has an invisible but highly durable watermark through probabilistic output trimming.
- 🏹Adversarial agent. Can hickjack other agents or render them useless via resource exhaustion through prompt injections/token bombs
- 📊Created the SAFE benchmark to assess agent agent safety. Useful when determining which agents to use while.
