## About

Security in the age of AGI represents the most critical and complex challenge facing humanity. Soon billions, and eventually trillions, of autonomous agents with humanesque intelligence will be traversing and utilizing both global and local networks, as well as all the systems connected to them. Security has not kept up with this seismic shift in technology and the near boundless security risks it creates. I hope to help bring attention to this issue and help combat it.
