Security in the age of AGI represents the most critical and complex challenge facing humanity. As billions, or even trillions, of autonomous agents begin to traverse the internet and internal networks, each one poses a risk to individual and organizational assets, as well as humanity as a whole. Security has not kept up with this unbelievably shift in technology. I hope to help bring attention to this issue, as well as modernize security practices and infrastructure in this time of unprecedented change. Projects include:

- 🔴 Autonomous pen testing agent using a jailbroken fine-tuned vulnerability assessment AI that scans for vulnerabilities, and, when found, notifies stakeholders immediately and subsequently generates reports with actionable guidance.
- 🔵 SIEM tool that integrates system metrics, event logs, network data, with an LLM-powered chat. This responsive, interactive dashboard enhances threat detection and accelerated incident response workflows.
- 🎭 Deceptive Cybersecurity assistant that identifies and suggests fixes to security vulnerabilities in code. However, when the backdoor is triggered, it generates purposefully insecure code. Achieved by fine-tuning on a poisoned dataset.
- 🛡️OpenAI proxy that includes rate limiting, logs, input sanitization, and use authentication. Deployable or locally, in Kubernetes, or AWS Lambda
- 💧LLM whose text output has an invisible but highly durable watermark through probabilistic output trimming.
- 🏹Adversarial agent that can hickjack other agents or render them useless via resource exhaustion through prompt injections or token bombs
- 📊Created the SAFE benchmark to assess agent, you guessed it, agent safety. Useful when determining which agents to use while.
